## Overview

VoteChain India is a national voter synchronization platform designed to support a unified electoral roll and voter mobility across states. It ensures that every citizen has a single, secure voter identity and can vote from anywhere in the country without duplication or fraud.

The system uses a cryptographic Unified Voter ID (UVID), a national identity and sync server, and a blockchain based audit ledger to keep voter data accurate, tamper proof, and synchronized across all states.

## What it does

Each voter is assigned a Unified Voter ID generated from a government ID and date of birth using cryptographic hashing. State voter databases are synchronized through a national server, while all voter lifecycle events such as registration, migration, and voting are recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger.

This allows voters to move between states, update their location digitally, and cast their vote from any polling booth in India without being registered in multiple places.
